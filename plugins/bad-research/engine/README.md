A **keyless** deep-research agent that runs as a Claude Code skill — a
fork-and-enhance of [hyperresearch](https://github.com/jordan-gibbs/hyperresearch).
It searches wide, filters garbage, grounds every claim to a source, and needs
**zero API keys**: the Claude Code host model supplies all inference, exactly like
hyperresearch. Optional local CLIs and a `[local]` neural extra are enhancements,
never requirements.

## Install

Bad Research is a small CLI that registers itself as a Claude Code skill. No API keys. Requires Python 3.11–3.13.

```bash
# Install the CLI (pipx or uv — either works)
pipx install bad-research
uv tool install bad-research

# Register the /bad-research skill into ~/.claude
bad install

# Verify
bad doctor
```

`bad install` writes the entry skill to `~/.claude/skills/bad-research/`; the per-step
skills install lazily on first use. For a project-local install instead of global, run
`bad install --project` inside the project. `bad doctor` shows what's wired (host model,
keyless search/browse, the optional external CLIs it can drive, the `[local]` neural stack).

## Use it in Claude Code

After `bad install`, open Claude Code in any project and either:

- **Invoke it directly** — type the slash command with your question:
  ```
  /bad-research Is open-source AI more dangerous than closed-source for national security?
  ```
- **Let Claude trigger it** — just ask a research-shaped question (*"write me a cited report
  comparing vector databases"*, *"literature review on GLP-1 drugs"*) and Claude loads the
  skill automatically.

It scales to the question: a simple lookup gets a fast cited answer in minutes; a broad or
contested one runs the full adversarially-reviewed pipeline (~1.5–2.5 h). The final report
and every fetched source land in a vault under `./research/` that compounds across sessions.

### Pick the depth (it auto-scales, or force it)

By default the skill **auto-routes** — a simple, bounded question takes the **fast** route
(a quick cited answer, minutes); a broad or contested one takes the **full**
adversarially-reviewed pipeline (~1.5–2.5 h). You can steer it:

- **Want a thorough report without the multi-hour wait?** The **fast** route is the sweet
  spot — its breadth branch fans out K parallel researchers over a wide multi-source browse,
  then writes a sectioned, fully-cited answer in minutes. Force it with `bad route --apply
  --fast` if the auto-router picked `full` and you want the quicker take. If you're just
  trying Bad Research out, start here.
- **Dial the effort** with `--effort minimal|low|medium|high` to nudge the route and per-step
  fan-out (`minimal`/`low` bias toward fast; `medium`/`high` toward full).
- **Dial the throughput** with `bad funnel-gather --concurrency N` (1–16, default 8) — how many
  provider searches run at once during the search fan-out. Raise it on a fast, tolerant network;
  lower it if searches start coming back empty.

There is deliberately **no unbounded / "use everything" mode**, and two measured limits are why.
The search backend is keyless and scraped, so it has no rate-limit contract: past a handful of
concurrent requests it soft-blocks, and a soft-block returns an empty result list that is
indistinguishable from "this topic has no sources" — an uncapped fan-out reports its own traffic
as a research gap. And reading past roughly 80 sources measurably *degrades* synthesis rather
than improving it, so the read ceiling is a report-quality bound, not a cost-saving one. The
knobs above give you the throughput control without either failure mode.

On an interactive run the skill announces the chosen route and its rough ETA before it
commits to a long job (and for `full` it shows the editable plan first), so you're never
surprised by a 2-hour job you didn't want. The route is decided from the step-1
decomposition and shown by that up-front in-skill route announcement — so you see which
route a query takes before any long work starts.

### Updating

Already installed? Upgrade the CLI **and** re-register the skill so both are current:

```bash
# From PyPI (pipx or uv — whichever you installed with)
pipx upgrade bad-research      # or: uv tool upgrade bad-research
bad install                    # refresh the /bad-research skill + agents in ~/.claude

# ...or track the latest source
pipx install --force git+https://github.com/LeventySeven/badresearch.git
bad install
```

`bad install` is idempotent — re-run it any time after upgrading the CLI to pull the newest
entry skill + agents (the per-step skills refresh lazily on the next `/bad-research` run).
Confirm with `bad --version`.

## What it does

A tier-adaptive pipeline turns a question into an audited, fully-cited report, and
every fetched source lands in a persistent, searchable vault that compounds across
sessions. Keyless by design:

- **Search** — the host `WebSearch` tool + DuckDuckGo + 7 scholarly APIs, fused and reranked by the host model.
- **Content** — a native fetch-and-clean pipeline (readability → markdown → optional LLM clean), SSRF-guarded.
- **Browse** — an agentic observe → act → extract loop driven by a local, keyless headless browser.
- **Retrieve** — SQLite FTS5/BM25 by default (no model required), with an optional local neural lane.
- **Ground** — every factual sentence must carry a source citation, and a deterministic ship-gate **blocks** any uncited claim. Fabricated quotes are caught for free by a byte-identity check; the harder paraphrase-faithfulness cases are judged by the host model (an optional `[local]` cross-encoder upgrades this to NLI).

## Reporting engine bugs

An engine/CLI defect — a missing or broken subcommand, a crash, a slim-build capability
gap — belongs in **this repo's** issue tracker, not in whatever downstream project
happened to be driving the run. File a fresh issue here with the build version and the
exact failing command; don't rely on a cross-org `gh issue transfer` to relocate it from
a downstream repo (transfers across organizations are unreliable and lose the report).
Keep the bug where the fix lives. This is guidance for **people**: the research agent
itself only surfaces the defect in its final report, and never files anything on its own.

## How it works & where the patterns came from

Bad Research takes hyperresearch as its base and enhances each stage with patterns
drawn from the best deep-research systems — Perplexity, Gemini, Firecrawl, Stagehand,
AgentQL, and others — reimplemented to run **keyless** on the host model. The full
write-up, stage by stage with provenance, is in
[**docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md**](docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md).
