"""Provider registry (keyless) + external-CLI detection.

Pure and network-free: `bad doctor` and `bad calibrate` use this to report the
keyless capability surface. Every provider is KEYLESS (host model + local OSS +
self-host) — `requires_key` is False on every row, so `active` reduces to
`import_present` for everything that runs IN-PROCESS.

The exception is `_HOST_BRIDGE_PROVIDERS` (`websearch`, `anthropic-host`):
adapters over a Claude-host tool that a `bad …` subprocess has no wire to. They
carry no import to check, so `import_present` is vacuously True — equating that
with "active" made `doctor` promise capability the engine could not deliver
(issue #35 §2). They remain keyless; they are simply reported honestly as
unreachable from here.

The external CLIs the skill drives (silver/agent-browser/lightpanda/yt-dlp/git) are
detected via `shutil.which` (no subprocess execution).
