"""fetch_tiered — the 4-rung KEYLESS escalation ladder (INTERFACES_KEYLESS §4.4, dossier 14 §7).

  rung 1   httpx GET (core/fetcher) ............... $0  static HTML/APIs
  rung 2   crawl4ai local JS render → fit_markdown . $0  clean MD, no interaction
  rung 2.5 silver (headless Chromium, read-only) ... $0  keyless JS render (snapshot/read)
  rung 3   silver --enable-actions ................. $0  login/click/typed/screenshot

Rungs 2.5/3 are ONE provider in two postures: the observe path never passes
`--enable-actions`, so silver refuses actor verbs outright, and only a host-supplied step
list unlocks them. agent-browser remains a drop-in fallback when silver is not installed
(`browse.base.get_browse_provider` prefers silver, then agent-browser); its own
lightpanda→chrome fallback still applies on that path.

Escalation gates KEPT verbatim from web/base.py (looks_like_junk / looks_like_login_wall).
There is NO rung that costs money. Every optional rung degrades gracefully: a missing
provider/CLI means the rung is skipped and the best lower-tier result is returned.
Providers are injectable for tests (_tier0/_tier1_factory/_browse/_extractor/_llm);
passing `_browse=None` explicitly means "no browse provider", NOT "resolve the default".

SSRF (same contract as the KR-3 content fix): the browse rung drives a REAL browser, so a
malicious page could redirect/navigate to an internal host. We reuse the shared denylist
predicate `core.fetcher.is_blocked_url` (the DRY single source of truth) to (a) gate the
browse-rung entry URL before driving the CLI, and (b) re-validate the final/landed URL the
provider reports (Snapshot.url → WebResult.url) and discard the result if it is internal.
The per-hop gap that (a)+(b) leave open is NOT closed by either backend — see the
`# SSRF LIMITATION` note in `_do_browse`. silver adds a DNS-RESOLVED check on the entry
URL (closing the rebinding variant our lexical denylist cannot see) and a CDP subresource
egress guard, but its navigation redirects run inside Chromium's `page.goto` and are not
individually re-checked, exactly as on agent-browser.
