"""Query router — classify the Step-1 decompose output into a pipeline mode.

Reuses the existing atomic-item analysis (no new classifier). The decision
tree (2-route consolidation; the former agentic-fast + light bands both map to
`fast` now — the split is an internal shape+effort knob, not a route):

  full  if multi-domain, contested, argumentative, time_periods, >=7 items, or a
        pipeline_tier == "full" floor
  fast  else (the bounded planner->writer loop — formerly agentic-fast/light)

[SEMANTIC-TIERING 2026-05-28] Two corrections to the post-B-5 behaviour:

  1. **`pipeline_tier == "full"` from decompose is an honoured FLOOR.** Step 1
     (bad-research-1-decompose.md) judges the SEMANTIC depth the query wants and
     writes `pipeline_tier`, with "Default is full; when uncertain, tier up". The
     router previously IGNORED that field and its docstring falsely claimed it
     "never down-routes a justified full". It now does: an explicit
     `pipeline_tier == "full"` forces `full` — mechanical heuristics may ESCALATE
     above the model's call but never DEMOTE below it. A missing / `"light"`
     pipeline_tier imposes no floor (so every fixture that omits it is unchanged).
  2. **The raised survey ceiling now requires an EXPLICIT breadth `modality`.** A
     merely lexically-inferred survey (detect_modality falling back to
     SURVEY_PHRASE_MARKERS, no explicit `modality` field) no longer buys the
     ROUTER_SURVEY_MAX_ATOMIC ceiling — it falls back to the depth-favouring deep
     ceiling ROUTER_LIGHT_MAX_ATOMIC. This kills the lexical "best X"→light demotion
     of deep single-subject queries while preserving the explicit-survey down-route.

    After each retrieval/critic ROUND the orchestrator calls this with the running
    `cumulative_tokens` and the opt-in `--max-tokens` `ceiling`. It returns True when
    the budget left for the rest of the run has fallen BELOW the reserved synthesis +
    grounding budget — i.e. ``ceiling - cumulative < RESERVE_FOR_SYNTHESIS``. On True,
    the orchestrator stops stepping (skips remaining retrieval/critic stages), takes
    the terminal ``short_circuit_to_synthesis`` step of `degrade_order`, and jumps to
    step 10/11 with whatever's been gathered — shipping a smaller-corpus grounded
    report instead of dying mid-pipeline.

    Inert when there is no ceiling (the `--max-tokens` cap is opt-in; ``None``/``0`` →
    nothing to reserve → never short-circuit). The comparison is STRICT: a remaining
    budget exactly equal to the reserve is still enough, so it does not fire."""

    """The RUN-LEVEL wall-clock "compose now" predicate — the SECOND, independent
    trigger for the same terminal ``short_circuit_to_synthesis`` step (it adds no new
    degrade step).

    The orchestrator calls this after each retrieval/critic ROUND with the run's
    elapsed wall-clock (now - the run's start timestamp, written at bootstrap). It
    returns True when the time left has fallen below the reserved synthesis +
    grounding window — ``deadline - elapsed < RESERVE_FOR_SYNTHESIS_S`` — at which
    point the orchestrator stops stepping and jumps to step 10/11 with whatever's
    gathered, shipping a smaller-corpus grounded report instead of being killed
    mid-pipeline with its in-flight agents.

    **Why this exists next to `should_short_circuit`:** that twin is opt-in
    (``--max-tokens``) and needs a cumulative token count no phase accounts for, so on
    a default `full` run the terminal degrade step was unreachable. Here the deadline
    DEFAULTS: ``deadline_s=None`` means ``FULL_TIMEOUT_S``, not "no deadline". Elapsed
    wall-clock is also the one budget the model cannot misreport (the fast route's
    "loop counters, not model claims" discipline).

    An explicit ``deadline_s <= 0`` is the deliberate opt-OUT (a run that wants no
    wall-clock net); a positive value overrides the default. The comparison is STRICT,
    mirroring the token twin: time left exactly equal to the reserve is still enough.
