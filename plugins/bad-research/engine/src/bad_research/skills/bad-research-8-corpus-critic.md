# Step 8 — Pre-draft corpus critic (targeted gap-fill)

**Tier gate:** `full` tier ONLY. Skip for `light`.

**Goal:** before drafting, ask "what source, if found, would overturn the current direction?" and run a targeted fetch wave to fill the most dangerous gaps. This is the highest-leverage intervention point in the pipeline — corrections applied before drafting cost nothing; corrections applied after drafting require patches and risk structural drift.

## Recover state

Read these inputs:
- `research/scaffold.md` — vault_tag
- `research/temp/tensions.md` — cross-locus + orphan tensions (the merged step-6 artifact; was `comparisons.md` + `source-tensions.json`)
- `research/loci.json` — scored loci
- `research/prompt-decomposition.json` — specifically the `time_periods` array

---

## Pre-flight: period-pinned primary-source coverage check

**Run this BEFORE spawning the corpus-critic subagent.** If `prompt-decomposition.json -> time_periods` is non-empty, walk every entry and verify the vault contains a primary source filed *for that exact period* — not "most recent", not narrative commentary, not earnings-call transcripts standing in for tabular filings.

For each `time_period` entry:

1. Search the vault for a primary source matching the `primary_source` description and the `issuer`:
   ```bash
   PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 bad search "<period> <issuer>" --tag <vault_tag> --include-body -j
   ```
2. Open the candidate notes (`note show <id> -j`) and verify the document's actual reporting period — the filing must cover the SPECIFIC period named in the prompt, not an adjacent one. A Q1 2025 10-Q does NOT satisfy "Q3 2024" — different period, different tabular data.
3. **If the period-pinned filing is missing, add it to `research/corpus-critic-gaps.json` as a `priority: critical` gap of type `period-pinned-primary` BEFORE spawning the corpus-critic subagent.** Schema:
   ```json
   {{
     "type": "period-pinned-primary",
     "target_position": "<period> exact figures for <issuer>",
     "search_queries": [
       "site:sec.gov 10-Q \"period ended September 30, 2024\" <issuer>",
       "<issuer> Q3 2024 10-Q filing PDF"
     ],
     "source_type": "primary-filing",
     "priority": "critical",
     "rationale": "Prompt names <period>; vault has no filing covering that exact period. Tabular line items only exist in the period-pinned filing. Without it, the draft will paraphrase rounded numbers from earnings calls and miss the rubric's exact figures."
   }}
   ```

The targeted fetch wave in the next step will pull these filings BEFORE the corpus-critic finishes its broader gap analysis. This ordering matters: numerical-precision misses are the largest single category of avoidable factual-accuracy failures.

## Procedure

1. **Spawn ONE `bad-research-corpus-critic` subagent** (Sonnet).

   **Spawn template:**
   ```
   subagent_type: bad-research-corpus-critic
   prompt: |
     RESEARCH QUERY (verbatim, gospel):
     > {{paste research/query-<vault_tag>.md body}}

     QUERY FILE: research/query-<vault_tag>.md

     PIPELINE POSITION: You are step 8 of the Bad Research pipeline.
     Step 6 produced research/temp/tensions.md (cross-locus + orphan
     tensions). After you return, the orchestrator runs a targeted fetch
     wave, then step 10 drafts.

     YOUR INPUTS:
     - corpus_tag: <vault_tag>
     - tensions_path: research/temp/tensions.md
     - loci_path: research/loci.json
     - output_path: research/corpus-critic-gaps.json
   ```

2. **Read the gaps output** (`research/corpus-critic-gaps.json`). Each gap has a `priority` (critical / high) and a `type` (overturning / strengthening / independent-verification).

3. **Targeted fetch wave.** Spawn **2–4 fetcher subagents** (Sonnet) to search for and fetch the sources identified in the gaps.

   **Spawn template:**
   ```
   subagent_type: bad-research-fetcher
   prompt: |
     RESEARCH QUERY (verbatim, gospel):
     > {{paste research/query-<vault_tag>.md body}}

     QUERY FILE: research/query-<vault_tag>.md

     PIPELINE POSITION: You are a step 8 fetcher (corpus-critic gap-fill)
     of the Bad Research pipeline. The corpus critic identified specific
     gaps; you fetch sources targeting those gaps. After you return, the
     orchestrator updates research/temp/tensions.md based on what you found.

     YOUR INPUTS:
     - vault_tag: <vault_tag>
     - search_queries: [<gap.search_queries>]
     - source_type: <gap.source_type>
     - gap_id: <gap.id>
   ```

4. **Assess results.**
   - **Overturning source found:** re-read the relevant committed position from the interim note. If the new source genuinely undercuts it, update `research/temp/tensions.md` to note the weakened position — the draft will handle it with appropriate calibration. Do NOT re-run the full depth investigation; adjust the position's confidence level.
   - **Overturning source NOT found:** the committed position gains confidence. Note this in `tensions.md` — "adversarial search for counter-evidence to [position] returned no substantive challenges."
   - **Strengthening/verification source found:** note the additional support in `tensions.md`. The draft can assert more confidently.

5. **Log results** to `research/temp/corpus-critic-results.md`:
   - Each gap: what was searched, what was found (or not), how it affects the committed positions
   - Updated confidence levels for any positions that changed

---

## Exit criterion

- `research/corpus-critic-gaps.json` exists
- All critical gaps attempted (fetched or documented as unfindable)
- `research/temp/corpus-critic-results.md` exists
- `research/temp/tensions.md` updated with confidence/strengthening/overturning notes

---

## Next step

Return to the entry skill (`bad-research`). Invoke step 10 (the evidence digest is now built inline in step 10.0b Part 2, replacing the former step 9):

```
Skill(skill: "bad-research-10-triple-draft")
