"""`bad doctor` — the keyless capability report. No network, no key checks.

Reports: the keyless-by-default banner, the keyless provider rows (host model +
keyless search/browse), the external keyless CLIs the skill drives (silver/
agent-browser/lightpanda/yt-dlp/git) with one-line install hints, and whether the optional
`[local]` neural stack is installed. SearXNG is intentionally silent — its provider
row only renders when `searxng_endpoint` is configured away from the localhost
default (opt-in, INTERFACES_KEYLESS §9).
