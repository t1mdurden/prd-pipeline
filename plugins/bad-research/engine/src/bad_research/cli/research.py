    """Keyless web providers for the STANDALONE / CLI funnel path (KR-2).

    The provider order MUST lead with providers that actually return results when the
    funnel runs as a `bad funnel-gather` subprocess. `WebSearchToolProvider`
    wraps Claude Code's *host* WebSearch tool; that tool is invoked by the
    orchestrator (the running agent), NOT by a Python subprocess — its
    `search_ex` raises `NotImplementedError` here. In light mode the funnel
    slices `deps.providers[:cfg.p_providers]` with `p_providers=1`, so a
    host-tool provider sitting at index 0 would starve the whole run (the slice
    would take ONLY the provider that can't run). We therefore lead with the
    keyless HTTP providers — `DdgsProvider` (multi-engine breadth) — so the
    light-mode `[:1]` slice always picks a working lane.

    `WebSearchToolProvider` is still appended LAST so the in-agent path (where a
    `links_source` is wired) can use it, and `fan_out` skips it cleanly when it
    raises `NotImplementedError`. An optional self-host SearXNG is added when
    configured. Every provider is cost_per_search=0.0, zero key. Degrades to []
    on import error.

    `skipped` (optional, issue #39): when a dict is passed, a lane we MEANT to
    build and could not is recorded as {name: "skipped-unconfigured"}. Without it
    the lane simply never appears in `providers`, so `fan_out` emits no row for it
    and the run reports a corpus gap on a topic it never actually searched.

    An UNCONFIGURED SearXNG is deliberately NOT recorded: it is opt-in
    infrastructure most installs never intend to run, so a row on every run would
    be noise that devalues the signal. Only a lane whose construction was

    `plan_queries` expansion is bypassed entirely — the model's lens plan is
    strictly richer than 16 generic suffixes. `max_queries` caps the plan;

    "degraded_reasons", "provider_outcomes", "coverage_gaps", "n_fetch_failed",
    "untrusted_notice"}. The model reads top_chunks only.

    `degraded` is the honest-failure seam — True when the run could not do its
    job. Two reasons, both exit 3:

    - `no_search_provider_available` — every lane refused to run (raised).
      Unambiguous infrastructure failure.
    - `no_search_results_from_any_provider` — every lane RAN and returned zero
      hits across the whole plan (12 queries in light, up to 100 in full).

    The second is deliberately treated as degraded even though it *could* be a
    genuinely sourceless topic. We cannot tell the two apart here, because the
    keyless providers swallow transport errors into [] — so a dead network is
    indistinguishable from a clean empty SERP at this layer. The asymmetry
    decides it: a false "degraded" costs one honest "couldn't build the corpus"
    message, while a false "healthy" ships a report asserting a research gap
    that is really an outage. Zero hits across every lane and every query is
    near-impossible for a well-formed query, so the false-positive rate is low
    and the failure it prevents is the one that silently corrupts output.

    `warnings` is ORTHOGONAL to `degraded`: an `ok: True` run can still carry a
    warning that it did not do what the caller asked (e.g. a supplied search
    plan that could not be parsed, so the deterministic fallback ran instead).

    `coverage_gaps` is ALSO orthogonal to `degraded`: lanes that could not answer
    (rate-limited / timed out / unreachable / never built) while another lane
    carried the run. `ok` stays True — the corpus IS usable — but the run did not
    search everything it meant to, so an absence in the corpus is not evidence of
    absence in the world. `n_fetch_failed` is the read-stage equivalent.

    `top_chunks` bodies are FENCED as untrusted content (BEGIN/END markers) with
    the preamble on the envelope's `untrusted_notice`. Pass `raw=True` for the
    unfenced bodies (programmatic text-matching consumers).
