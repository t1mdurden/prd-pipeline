"""gather() — the public funnel entry point. Wires Stage A→B→C→D→E→F.

INVARIANT: callers receive list[Chunk] (reranked top chunks) + [[note-id]]
pointers — NEVER raw page bodies. Sources scale (12→80 notes); context stays
flat (~5-15k tokens) because only Stage-F chunks ever cross into the prompt.

Stages A-E run at $0 model cost. The seams (providers/fetch_tiered/postfetch_
filter/RetrievalEngine/vault) are injected via FunnelDeps so the funnel logic
is testable in isolation; the width-sweep skill backend (Plan 08) assembles the
real wiring. Every SYNCHRONOUS seam (search_ex, fetch_tiered) is reached through
funnel._async.acall inside fan_out / read_top_k.
